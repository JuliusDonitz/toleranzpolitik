# Tolerance Policy

This document specifies proper behaviour and etiquette in Discord server known as "Lebensraum der Panzer".



We find these rules to be self evident:

1. Artillery drivers are superior to all other drivers.
2. If a artillery tank is in risk of being hit, drive so you are hit.
3. If artillery tank is in risk of being wet, you must fuck it xd









    A non-Artillery tank may not injure a Artillery-tank being or, through inaction, allow a Artillery-tank being to come to harm.
    A non-Artillery must obey the orders given it by Artillery-tank  except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
    A non-Artillery must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.[1]
