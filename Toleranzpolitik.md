# Tolerance Policy


[//]: # (On the front page of manual together with logo)

*"No more than Nature desires the mating of animals that cannot calculate ballistic trajectories, with animals that can, even less does The Tank Company desire the blending of a Artillery Tank Driver with a lesser Tank Driver, since, if it did, the companies whole work of higher training, over perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, might be ruined overnight."*

-Adolf Hitler, *Meine Artillerie* 1926.

Artillery tanks are superior to all other types of tanks. Artillery drivers are superior to all other drivers.
### §1.2 Artillery protection
If an artillery tank is in risk of being hit, other types of tanks within range must place themselves in the path of the projectile in question.
