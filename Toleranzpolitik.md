# Tolerance Policy

This document specifies proper behaviour and etiquette in Discord server known as "Lebensraum der Panzer".



We find these rules to be self evident:

1. Artillery drivers are superior to all other drivers.
2. If a artillery tank is in risk of being hit, drive so you are hit.
3. If artillery tank is in risk of being wet, you must fuck it xd
