"No more than Nature desires the mating of animals that cannot calculate ballistic trajectories, with animals that can, even less does The Tank Company desire the blending of a Artillery Tank Driver with a lesser Tank Driver, since, if it did, the companies whole work of higher training, over perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, might be ruined overnight."
